## Notes
- To have  alogin page? Will need to think about how employer would provide default info.
  - Would need to try having authentication area.
- Or default login jessjelly

- making requests to heroku: read notes to solve CORS error

- make most of routing - to make site feel bigger

- read into hooks. To use?

## Questions
- is there just one <Router> in the entire frontend?

## Ideally
- ArtSmCard: want entire article name + author area to be clickable like a button without horrible lines around it
