## Questions
How to change backend to return tot article count?
- maybe that goes on endpoints rounter?

## Ideally
- if comment belongs to loggedin user, make it a prettier colour
  - when jj posts comment, it should be grey (ideally with some sort of diagonal lines) until post successful
- refactor handleClick in Articles using that way of mapping from several vals to one val...


### Tomorrow
- Make Articles component work within Home, Topic. How to pass in correct params and remember ultiple changes to params?
- Decide how to show comments
  - small view of top three at bottom of article
  - Larger view (also at bottom of A) shows top 3 expanded, and then 10 (other) most recent. All expanded?
    - Perhaps better (in both large and small view) to allow expansion of text on an article by article basis)
- button not conditionally disappearing
- handle redundant article route
- allow up AND DOWN votes

- rem to change backend endpoints descriptions
