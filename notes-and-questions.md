## Notes
- To have  alogin page? Will need to think about how employer would provide default info.
  - Would need to try having authentication area.
- Or default login jessjelly

- making requests to heroku: read notes to solve CORS error
- make most of routing - to make site feel bigger
- read into hooks. To use?

## Ideally
- if comment belongs to loggedin user, make it a prettier colour
  - when jj posts comment, it should be grey (ideally with some sort of diagonal lines) until post successful
- refactor handleClick in Articles using that way of mapping from several vals to one val...


### Tomorrow
- rem to change backend endpoints descriptions

Warning: can't perform React state update on unmounted component?!?!
