## Notes
- To have  alogin page? Will need to think about how employer would provide default info.
  - Would need to try having authentication area.
- Or default login jessjelly

- making requests to heroku: read notes to solve CORS error

- make most of routing - to make site feel bigger

- read into hooks. To use?

## Questions
- Articles holds all articles including art body. Can click on article to navigate to page Article. This updates query with article\_id.
  - But (QUESTION) do not need to make fresh axios request for article with this id. Just need that id to get the associated comments.

## Ideally
- ArtSmCard: want entire article name + author area to be clickable like a button without horrible lines around it
