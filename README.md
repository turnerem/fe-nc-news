# NC-News Frontend

This is the frontend for the NC News app. It's hosted on Heroku. You can check it out [here](https://fe-nc-news-4543524.herokuapp.com). It forms part of the body of work that I completed in [NorthCoders] (https://northcoders.com) coding bootcamp.

Another project was to build out the backend of the news app. That's also on Heroku, [here](https://whispering-river-81489.herokuapp.com/api). The Git repo is [here] (https://github.com/turnerem/be-nc-news).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
