# NC-News Frontend

This is the frontend for the NC News app. It's hosted on Heroku. You can check it out [here](https://fe-nc-news-4543524.herokuapp.com). It forms part of the body of work that I completed in [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com) coding bootcamp.

The website demonstrates my ability to work with React and Javascript. Some key features of functionality:
- infinite scrolling through articles and comments
- D3 animations of (fake) trends in the [topics](https://fe-nc-news-4543524.herokuapp.com/topics) section
- ability to post a comment
- ability to sort articles and comments by date/popularity/etc

NOTE: This is not a real news site. The users are fictional, articles are ridiculous, and comments are spurious.

The backend of the NC News app is another portfolio piece that I completed at Northcoders. That's also on Heroku, [here](https://whispering-river-81489.herokuapp.com/api). The GitHub repo is [here](https://github.com/turnerem/be-nc-news).
